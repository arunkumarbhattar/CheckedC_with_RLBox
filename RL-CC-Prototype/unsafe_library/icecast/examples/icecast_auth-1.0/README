icecast_auth - README
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a fairly simple application created to show off some of the
capabilities of icecast's url authenticator.  It's a set of PHP scripts
for setting up and managing a simple subscription-based stream or set
of streams.  I tried to include as much functionality as I could,
without going overboard.  If you are finding that it doesn't have the
features you need, then by all means, enhance it and share it with
the community. 

icecast_auth is distributed under the GNU GPL, version 2. A copy of this
license is included with this software in the COPYING file.

Prerequisites
---------------------------------------------------------------------

* php - I'm not much of a php'er, so I think php4 is required, but don't
        quote me on that.
* mysql - you need this to store your users and mountpoints.

Setup
---------------------------------------------------------------------
You'll need to first create your database and tables needed by the
scripts.  There is an icecast_auth.sql script in the distribution which
has all the table definitions. You'll need to run it using something
like phpmyAdmin.

Edit and change the info in config.php.  The admin user/pass is what
you will be logging in with.  The rest is info needed to connect to 
whatever mysql db you have setup.

Hit the main index.php page and login using the admin user/pass.

You'll need to add mountpoints for each of your streams that you want
to secure with the url authenticator, and then add your users one by one.
Want a batch uploader ? Did I mention that this was a *simple* application ?

I've included some reports that you can use for seeing what is going on,
when your mounts are connecting/disconnecting, what your listeners are doing,
how long they are doing it...yadda-yadda...

Configuring your Icecast server to use it
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This part is pretty simple, you need to create a "mount specific" option 
as such :

<mount>
	<mount-name>/stream.ogg</mount-name>
	<authentication type="url">
		<option name="listener_add"    value="http://myauthserver.com/icecast_auth/action.php"/>
		<option name="listener_remove" value="http://myauthserver.com/icecast_auth/action.php"/>
		<option name="mount_add"       value="http://myauthserver.com/icecast_auth/action.php"/>
		<option name="mount_remove"    value="http://myauthserver.com/icecast_auth/action.php"/>
	</authentication>
</mount>

All actions in this example are handled by the single action.php script.

You will need to explicitly name each mountpoint you want secured.  If you need more
help than this, check out the icecast main documentation.
